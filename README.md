## Opinions on Stallman

* Stallman is a good guy, he is not evil.
* Stallman has no filter.
* The Epstien incident was a misunderstanding.
  * Basically he didnt know his teacher would do such a thing.
  * And, since he has 0 filter, he said that Sexual Assault has to do with sex, not the mind.

## Opinions on Linus Torvalds

* He created Linux
* He rages alot
* lololol NVIDIA fuck you is actually kinda funny tho
* perhaps he should curse out Windows 11 next? perhaps he should admit his own creation has become a monster? who knows.

## Opinions on Oklomsy.

i fucking hate oklomsy. he is a bad human, see https://sparksammy.com/oklomsy-truth. I am no saint either, but if you add him and "befriend" him you will see why I raged near the end. i say befriend in quotes bc you cannot befriend Oklomsy unless you are good in his eyes, which is near impossible.

## Opinions on Daft Punk

they are way too over rated. i mean look, they take something sounding like a default demo midi from a casio keyboard and make millions. like what's the deal with that??? daft punk stans are probably going brrr about now lmao.

## Opinions on it/they/them

perhaps it should be per/pers/person because it makes more sence in the english language? maybe it's just me.

* i hate trump.
* the orange man is truely bad.

* Also a fan of retro computing and video games, kinda like me.
* Over all a great dude.

## Opinions on Gordon Ramsay

* He curses a ton, so thats annoying.
* He has helped people however, with their restaurants and hotels, so that's good.
* Over all a good guy, yet he has a potty mouth and a very scary yell.
* Please don't yell at me Gordon, remember: you read the title of this page, you should have expected this.
